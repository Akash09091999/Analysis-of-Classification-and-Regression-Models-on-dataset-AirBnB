## Description

- Pricing a rental apartment on Airbnb is a daunting task
for owners because it determines the number of customers
in the location. The customer should evaluate the proposed
price with the least knowledge of the best value. In this
project I analyzed a powerful price prediction model that
uses machine learning, deep learning, and natural language
processing techniques to help owners and customers
estimate prices with the least available information about
the property. Rental characteristics, landlord characteristics,
and customer ratings will include predictor variables and
use a variety of methods, from linear regression to support
vector regression (SVR), k-means clustering (KMC), neural
network (NN) and tree-based models for build a predictive
model. Various methods are used to test the yield, such as
ROC curve and kappa value.

## Visuals

- Visuals are very important! You might want to include screenshots of your code in operation. GIFS are also great!
- Just use the "![ ]()" to input images.

## Acknowledgements
I   would   like   to   express   my   sincere   gratitude   to   mysupervisor,  Professor  Dr.  T.  Tomesh  for  his  immeasurablesupport  and  guidance  throughout  my  research  studies.  Hispatience  and  guidance  help  me  overcome  challenges  andfinish  this  project.  Without  professor  Tomesh’s  guidance,this   project   would   not   have   been   possible.   This   is   toplace  on  record  our  appreciation  and  deep  gratitude  to  theprofessor.  I  express  our  sincere  thanks  to  faculties,  Headof   the   Department,   at   LAKEHEAD   UNIVERSITY   forextending their help. Finally, I would like to thank everyonewho  directly  or  indirectly  helped  us  implement  our  projectsuccessfully.

## Road-map (future ideas)
The future work in this research may include (i) exploringother  feature  selection  schemes,  such  as  the  importanceof  random  forest  features,  (ii)  further  experimenting  withneural  network  architectures,  and  (iii)  obtaining  additionaltraining   examples   from   others   hospitality   services,   suchas  VRBO,  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  K-meansclustering, especially through the Ridge regression model.

## Necessary Things for a README

Depending on exactly what sort of project you are doing, there are a number of things that you may or may not want to include in a readme. There is really no **one true way** to do it. Readme's are a kind of _artform_.

*__However__* there are a few things that you should consider including:

1. Name of your project.
2. Description of your project.
3. Badges.
4. Graphics / Visuals
5. Install Instructions
6. Usage (how does one use the program once it is installed.)
7. Support / Contact Details.
8. Road-map (future ideas)
9. How to contribute
10. Authors / Acknowledgements (give credit where credit is due!)
11. License
12. Project Status

## Name of your Project

- This should be, simply, the name of your project.. maybe with some kind of a version Number

## Description of your project

- This is a brief, but accurate description telling potential users _exactly_ what your project is about. This is akin to an "abstract" in academic works. 

## Badges
https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7-green
https://img.shields.io/badge/Languages-1-blue
![social](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/trevortomesh?style=social)![twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/trevortomesh?style=social)![languages](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/trevortomesh/research-methods-class)

- Badges are small images that convey meta data such as whether or not all the tests are passing, version numbers, languages used, etc. 
- Get badges at shields.io

## Visuals

- Visuals are very important! You might want to include screenshots of your code in operation. GIFS are also great!
- Just use the "![ ]()" to input images.

## Installation 

- Describe how your software / development is installed. Sometimes it's easy as something like:

```bash
sudo apt-get install my-cool-thing
```

- often it involves a bit of  downloading sources and building:

```bash
git clone my-cool-repo.git
cd /my-cool-repo
cd /build
make
```

- You should list out steps as unambiguously as humanly possible!!
- Often people don't read the actual install instructions, but they just copy and paste what is in the black boxes. __Keep this in mind!__

## Usage

- Describe how the program / project is going to be used once it is installed. 
- If it is a command line app, you'll want to give CLI examples:

```bash
cool-project -arg1 -arg2
```

- then maybe show a screenshot of  the results :smile:

## Support

- tell users how they can get a hold of you

Contact: [email me](trevor.tomesh@gmail.com)

## Road-map

- List your panned future developments
- This is a good way to keep track of what it is that you want to do in the future!


## License

- Depending on what kind of project you are doing, you might have a specific copyright. 
- Usually on github, everything is open source!
- You can find license info here: [license](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/licensing-a-repository)

## Project Status

- A lot of the time people will abandon projects. You should always at least let people know if you aren't interested in working on a project anymore!
- Someone might want to pick it up on your behalf!
