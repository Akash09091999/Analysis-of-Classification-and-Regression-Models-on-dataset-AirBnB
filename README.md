## Description

- Pricing a rental apartment on Airbnb is a daunting task
for owners because it determines the number of customers
in the location. The customer should evaluate the proposed
price with the least knowledge of the best value. In this
project I analyzed a powerful price prediction model that
uses machine learning, deep learning, and natural language
processing techniques to help owners and customers
estimate prices with the least available information about
the property. Rental characteristics, landlord characteristics,
and customer ratings will include predictor variables and
use a variety of methods, from linear regression to support
vector regression (SVR), k-means clustering (KMC), neural
network (NN) and tree-based models for build a predictive
model. Various methods are used to test the yield, such as
ROC curve and kappa value.

## Install Instructions
After Installing Python, install the following libraries using the pip command. 

Syntax of using pip command is : "pip install \<nameOfLibrary\>" without quotes, example "pip install matplotlib".

-cycler==0.10.0
-Jinja2==3.0.1
-joblib==1.0.1
-kiwisolver==1.3.1
-MarkupSafe==2.0.1
-matplotlib==3.4.3
-numpy==1.21.2
-pandas==1.3.2
-Pillow==8.3.1
-pyparsing==2.4.7
-python-dateutil==2.8.2
-pytz==2021.1
-scikit-learn==0.24.2
-scipy==1.7.1
-seaborn==0.11.2
-six==1.16.0
-threadpoolctl==2.2.0
-jupyter notebook==6.4.0

## Usage
- After installing all the libraries used in the project, the project will open perfectly in Jupyter Notebook that will be visible in browser.
- Open command prompt and reach to the project directory, and in the "AirBnB NYC" folder, type jupyter notebook, this will start the notebook server on localhost port 8888
- Now, open the browser with the link, localhost:8888 and open the Notebook file: "AirBnB.ipynb" in the browser.
- This file will contain all the cells of code which have to be executed in the same sequence as observed in the file.
- To alter the code, you have to rerun the cells in the same sequence to maintain the compatibility in variables used by the models.
- The final output will be provided to you at the end representing the comparison of all the algorithms used in a tabular format(dynamic as per your alteration of code and data).

## Road-map (future ideas)
The future work in this research may include (i) exploring other  feature  selection  schemes,  such  as  the  importance of  random  forest  features,  (ii)  further  experimenting  with neural  network  architectures,  and  (iii)  obtaining  additional training   examples   from   others   hospitality   services,   suchas  VRBO,  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  K-means clustering, especially through the Ridge regression model.

## Acknowledgements
I   would   like   to   express   my   sincere   gratitude   to   my supervisor,  Professor  Dr.  T.  Tomesh  for  his  immeasurable support  and  guidance  throughout  my  research  studies.  His patience  and  guidance  help  me  overcome  challenges  and finish  this  project.  Without  professor  Tomesh’s  guidance, this   project   would   not   have   been   possible.   This   is   to place  on  record  our  appreciation  and  deep  gratitude  to  the professor.  I  express  our  sincere  thanks  to  faculties,  Head of   the   Department,   at   LAKEHEAD   UNIVERSITY   for extending their help. Finally, I would like to thank everyone who  directly  or  indirectly  helped  us  implement  our  project successfully.

## Project Status

- Currently I have made the model and trained it in a very small data of New York City, but in future, I am planning to cover metropolitan area which will also have more attributes that affect the housing price, so in order to consider those factory, the model have to be changed by adding more parameters in the priority manner so to make the prediction nearly perfect.

- To do so, if anyone is also interested in the same idea of mine, I invite all with an open heart to collaborate with me in this research and make the model as useful as possible.
